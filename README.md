# semantically-enriched-link-prediction-datasets

In this repository is available:

* The datasets DB100k+, Yago3-10+ and NELL-995+ which are the standard datasets DB100k, Yago3-10 and NELL-995 which are enriched with their related entity types and related predicates domains and range
* The notebooks that generated these datasets
* A masking algorithm allowing to create variants of these datasets with target proportion of the predicates domain/range information
* An example of such dataset with a version of NELL-995 with 10% of triples with predicates with dfines domain and range, 30% with only the domain known, 10% with nly the range known and 50% of unknown domain and range
